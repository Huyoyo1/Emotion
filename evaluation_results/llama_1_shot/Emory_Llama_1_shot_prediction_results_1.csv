Sad,"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.

Mad,Of course it was a line!,Mad
Mad,"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?",Mad
Neutral,I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.,Mad
Mad,I hate men! I hate men!,Mad
Peaceful,"Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.",Peaceful
Mad,Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?,Mad

Neutral,"Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...",Sad
Neutral,Why don't you just get a roommate?,Mad

Powerful,"...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.",Neutral
Neutral,"Okay, alright, I have a question, then.",Neutral
Neutral,Yuh.,Mad
Neutral,"Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?",Sad
Joyful,"Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.",Joyful
Neutral,Sure.,Neutral
Scared,"Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.",Peaceful
Joyful,"Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.",Joyful

Neutral,"Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.",Peaceful
Joyful,"Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?",Mad
Joyful,I can hop.,Joyful
Scared,Hello?,Joyful
Joyful,Hey!,Neutral

Neutral,Oh.,Neutral
Neutral,Do not start without me. Do not start without me.,Mad
Joyful,"Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a ""I gotta have you now"" kind of thing?",Joyful
Joyful,"Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.",Sad
Neutral,"Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?",Mad

Neutral,"So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.",Neutral
Neutral,Mockolate.,Joyful
Scared,I'm sorry?,Sad
Neutral,Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.,Mad
Scared,Ohh.,Sad
Powerful,"Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.",Joyful
Mad,All right. Mmm-mmm.,Joyful
Neutral,Yeah?,Mad
Mad,"I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.",Joyful
Powerful,"No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.",Joyful
Mad,Mmm-mmm.,Joyful
Powerful,"But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.",Joyful
Neutral,Wow.,Joyful
Neutral,Aren't you going to swallow that?,Neutral
Mad,Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.,Neutral
Powerful,"Yeah, isn't that great?",Joyful
Mad,Mmm.,Joyful

Joyful,We'll put buckles on it.,Joyful
Neutral,Hey.,Joyful
Neutral,Hey.,Neutral
Neutral,Hey.,Neutral
Neutral,"Did uh, Ross call?",Sad
Sad,"No, I'm sorry.",Sad
Mad,"Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, ""Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together.""",Sad
Powerful,"No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.",Mad
Scared,"I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.",Scared
Mad,"Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.",Joyful
Peaceful,"Hey, here's a thought, Ross.",Joyful
Mad,Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.,Mad
Joyful,"Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.",Mad
Peaceful,"Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.",No valid emotion found
Neutral,Can't we just use a pen?,Mad
Joyful,"No, Amish boy.",Mad
Neutral,"Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.",Mad
Peaceful,"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.",Mad
Neutral,You could say that.,Neutral
Peaceful,"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.",Mad
Joyful,Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?,Neutral
Neutral,I don't know.,Mad
Joyful,"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.",Mad
Neutral,"Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?",Sad
Sad,She's not Rachel.,Mad
Neutral,"Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.",Joyful
Mad,Oh my god.,Joyful
Scared,Oh my god good?,Mad
Mad,"Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.",Mad
Sad,"Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!",Mad
Joyful,"My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.",Mad
Powerful,"You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.",Joyful
Scared,I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.,Mad
Neutral,"Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.",Mad
Neutral,What?,Mad
Neutral,What?,Mad
Joyful,"Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.",Joyful
Neutral,This was your idea?,Mad
Neutral,What were you thinking?,Mad
Peaceful,"All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.",Mad
Neutral,Yeah. You!,Joyful
Scared,"All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?",Mad
Neutral,"Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.",Mad
Scared,"Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!",Joyful
Mad,"When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.",Mad
Neutral,I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.,Peaceful
Mad,Not interested.,Mad
Neutral,"Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.",Joyful
Peaceful,Number six: the way you smell.,Mad
Peaceful,"Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?",Neutral
Neutral,"Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?",Neutral
Joyful,"Oh, yeah, I do.",Joyful
Neutral,What are you doing out there?,Neutral
Scared,"I am, uh, I am...",Sad
Peaceful,"Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?",Joyful
Scared,"Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.",Mad
Mad,No.,Mad
Scared,No?,Mad
Mad,That's what I said.,Mad
Scared,"Look, maybe we should go?",Sad
Mad,"No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.",Neutral
Scared,"Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.",Mad
Sad,"No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.",Sad
Peaceful,"No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.",Joyful
Sad,"Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!",Mad
Peaceful,"You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.",Joyful
Scared,"Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.",Mad
Scared,"I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.",Neutral
Neutral,"Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.",Neutral
Neutral,Doesn't matter.,Mad
Scared,What?,Mad
Sad,Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.,Sad
Sad,"Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.",Sad
Sad,"Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?",Mad
Scared,"Well, uh, I ate some.",Neutral
Neutral,"Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?",Mad
Neutral,Hello?,Neutral
Neutral,Hi.,Neutral
Peaceful,"Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.",Mad
Neutral,"Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.",Sad
Scared,"Look, can, can you do something for me?",Mad
Powerful,"Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?",Mad
Powerful,"The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.",Sad
Joyful,"Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.",Mad
Neutral,"Hi, thanks for coming in again.",Neutral
Sad,"Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.",Mad
Neutral,"It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called ""fishtachios"". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?",No valid emotion found
Sad,Cat hair.,Neutral
Sad,"Oh, sorry.",Neutral
Joyful,"Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.",Mad
Joyful,"Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.",Mad
Powerful,"Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?",Mad
Joyful,Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.,Joyful
Neutral,What're you doing?,Neutral
Joyful,Just waiting for you sweetie.,Joyful
Neutral,Are you remaking the bed?,Neutral
Sad,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.",Peaceful
Neutral,"Then, you're redoing it because...",Mad
Sad,"If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.",Mad
Scared,You're pretty much running that risk either way.,Mad
Sad,"Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.",Neutral
Neutral,"Oh, well that's not so crazy.",Neutral
Joyful,I'm just easing you in.,Neutral
Neutral,"Oh, alright.",Neutral
Peaceful,"Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.",Sad
Peaceful,"Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.",Joyful
Joyful,"Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.",Joyful
Neutral,"Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.",Neutral
Scared,But don't you need experience for a job like that?,Neutral
Peaceful,"It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.",Mad
Joyful,"Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.",Neutral
Mad,"Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.",Joyful
Peaceful,No kidding.,Mad
Powerful,"Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.",Mad
Neutral,Where do you work?,Neutral
Neutral,"Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.",Neutral
Neutral,I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.,Joyful
Joyful,"Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...",Joyful
Joyful,Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?,Joyful
Joyful,"Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.",Joyful
Joyful,"You look fabulous honey, you really do.",Joyful
Joyful,"Yeah? Are you sure, really.",Mad
Scared,"You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.",Mad
Sad,"I, I, I'm hideous.",Sad
Neutral,It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.,Joyful
Neutral,Come in.,Neutral
Peaceful,"Hey baby, I'm back...",Joyful
Neutral,"Hey Ryan, what's up?",Neutral
Neutral,What's goin' on?,Mad
Sad,"Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.",Scared
Neutral,Chicken or small?,Joyful
Joyful,Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.,Sad
Neutral,Why aren't you at home in bed?,Mad
Joyful,"'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.",Joyful
Scared,"I'm sorry, I never had 'em.",Sad
Scared,"Ohh, ohh.",Joyful
Powerful,"If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.",Mad
Mad,"Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.",Mad
Neutral,Can I please see your face?,Joyful
Scared,Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.,Scared
Peaceful,"Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.",Mad
Scared,"And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.",Scared
Peaceful,"Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.",Sad
Sad,"I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.",Sad
Joyful,"Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.",Powerful
Joyful,"Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.",Joyful
Neutral,Hey.,Neutral
Peaceful,"Hey, how's the first day goin'?",Neutral
Peaceful,Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.,Neutral
Neutral,Well there you go.,Neutral

Neutral,"Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?",Neutral

Neutral,I figure my character has kids.,Neutral
Scared,Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.,Mad
Joyful,"Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.",Neutral
Peaceful,"Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.",Neutral
Joyful,"Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.",Joyful
