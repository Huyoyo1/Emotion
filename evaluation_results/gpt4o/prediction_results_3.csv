2,1,Neutral,Neutral,Mockolate.,3
2,1,Scared,Neutral,I'm sorry?,3
2,1,Neutral,Neutral,Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.,3

2,1,Powerful,Neutral,"Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.",3
2,1,Mad,Neutral,All right. Mmm-mmm.,3
2,1,Neutral,Neutral,Yeah?,3
2,1,Mad,Joyful,"I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.",3
2,1,Powerful,Neutral,"No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.",3
2,1,Mad,Neutral,Mmm-mmm.,3
2,1,Powerful,Neutral,"But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.",3
2,1,Neutral,Neutral,Wow.,3
2,1,Neutral,Neutral,Aren't you going to swallow that?,3
2,1,Mad,Neutral,Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.,3

2,2,Neutral,Neutral,How about Mockolate mousse?,3
2,2,Mad,Neutral,"It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.",3
2,2,Neutral,Neutral,"Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?",3
2,2,Neutral,Neutral,What makes it pilgrim?,3

2,3,Scared,Scared,"I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.",3
2,3,Mad,Mad,"Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.",3
2,3,Peaceful,Neutral,"Hey, here's a thought, Ross.",3
2,3,Mad,Mad,Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.,3

2,3,Peaceful,Powerful,"Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.",3
2,3,Neutral,Neutral,Can't we just use a pen?,3
2,3,Joyful,Mad,"No, Amish boy.",3
2,3,Neutral,Joyful,"Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.",3
2,3,Peaceful,Neutral,"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.",3
2,3,Neutral,Neutral,You could say that.,3
2,3,Peaceful,Neutral,"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.",3
2,3,Joyful,Neutral,Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?,3
2,3,Neutral,Neutral,I don't know.,3
2,3,Joyful,Neutral,"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.",3
2,3,Neutral,Neutral,"Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?",3
2,3,Sad,Sad,She's not Rachel.,3
2,4,Neutral,Neutral,"Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.",3
2,4,Mad,Mad,Oh my god.,3
2,4,Scared,Neutral,Oh my god good?,3
2,4,Mad,Mad,"Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.",3
2,4,Sad,Mad,"Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!",3
2,5,Joyful,Joyful,"My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.",3
2,5,Powerful,Neutral,"You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.",3
2,5,Scared,Mad,I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.,3
2,5,Neutral,Powerful,"Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.",3
2,5,Neutral,Mad,What?,3
2,5,Neutral,Mad,What?,3
2,5,Joyful,Mad,"Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.",3
2,5,Neutral,Mad,This was your idea?,3
2,5,Neutral,Mad,What were you thinking?,3
2,5,Peaceful,Peaceful,"All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.",3
2,5,Neutral,Mad,Yeah. You!,3
2,5,Scared,Mad,"All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?",3

2,6,Scared,Scared,"Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!",3
2,6,Mad,Mad,"When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.",3
2,6,Neutral,Powerful,I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.,3
2,6,Mad,Mad,Not interested.,3
2,6,Neutral,Joyful,"Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.",3

2,6,Neutral,Neutral,What are you doing out there?,3
2,6,Scared,Sad,"I am, uh, I am...",3
2,6,Peaceful,Joyful,"Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?",3

2,6,Scared,Scared,"Look, maybe we should go?",3
2,6,Mad,Sad,"No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.",3
2,6,Scared,Sad,"Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.",3
2,6,Sad,Sad,"No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.",3
2,6,Peaceful,Powerful,"No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.",3
2,6,Sad,Mad,"Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!",3
2,6,Peaceful,Powerful,"You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.",3
2,6,Scared,Mad,"Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.",3
2,6,Scared,Neutral,"I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.",3
2,7,Neutral,Neutral,"Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.",3
2,7,Neutral,Neutral,Doesn't matter.,3
2,7,Scared,Scared,What?,3
2,7,Sad,Neutral,Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.,3
2,7,Sad,Sad,"Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.",3
2,7,Sad,Neutral,"Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?",3
2,7,Scared,Scared,"Well, uh, I ate some.",3
2,7,Neutral,Neutral,"Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?",3
2,8,Neutral,Neutral,Hello?,3

2,8,Powerful,Neutral,"Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?",3
2,8,Powerful,Sad,"The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.",3
2,8,Joyful,Mad,"Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.",3
2,9,Neutral,Neutral,"Hi, thanks for coming in again.",3
2,9,Sad,Neutral,"Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.",3
2,9,Neutral,Neutral,"It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called ""fishtachios"". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?",3
2,9,Sad,Neutral,Cat hair.,3
2,9,Sad,Neutral,"Oh, sorry.",3
3,0,Joyful,Peaceful,"Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.",3
3,0,Joyful,Joyful,"Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.",3
3,0,Powerful,Neutral,"Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?",3
3,0,Joyful,Neutral,Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.,3
