# Emotion

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for Utterance-Level Emotion Recognition using Large Language Models (LLMs), as described in the paper "Evaluating Emotion Recognition in Large Language Models with Contextual Understanding". The study explores the effectiveness of large language models, such as Gpt-3.5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.1, and GEMMA2, in recognizing emotions within dialogues. The repository supports both single-model and multi-model emotion recognition approaches.

## Models Used
LLaMA 3.1 \
GEMMA 2 \
GPT-3.5 \
GPT-4o 

## Dataset
Three public benchmark datasets were used for the experiments:
MELD: Multi-modal EmotionLines Dataset (text, audio, and video from TV shows).
EmoryNLP: Emotional annotations of dialogues from the TV series "Friends."
DailyDialog: Multi-turn dialogues annotated with emotions and communicative intents.

## Acknowledgments
This research was supported by guidance from Dmitry Adamskiy and Omer Gunes. The datasets used in this research were sourced from publicly available repositories.
